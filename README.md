# Simple Rasterizer

A simple rasterizer in C, using only the Win32 API. Implements the pseudo-rasterizer as illustrated in the second chapter of [Computer Graphics from Scratch](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/).

## Functionality
- [X] - **Lines** - Implementing line rasterizing & core engine code
- [ ] - **Filled Triangles** - Implementing rasterization of triangles
- [ ] - **Shaded Triangles** - Implements rasterization of triangles filled with color gradient
- [ ] - **Perspective Projection** - Implements rasterization of 3D objects
- [ ] - **Describing and Rendering a Scene** - Implements representation of arbitrary types of objects in a scene
- [ ] - **Clipping** - The techniques needed to identify objects behind the camera
- [ ] - **Hidden Surface Removal** - Removing surfaces that are not visible from the camera
- [ ] - **Shading** - Implementing lights into the scene
- [ ] - **Textures** - Addind visual detail to the surfaces of objects
- [ ] - **Extending the Rasterizer** - Normal mapping, shadows etc.
